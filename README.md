# Ungoogled-Chromium-Portable
A portable version of the Ungoogled Chromium Browser built on Chrome++.
Ungoogled Chromium is a minimalist and excellent browser. However, the official version does not offer a portable edition, which is quite inconvenient when changing the computer system or carrying it on a mobile storage device. Therefore, with the help of Chrome++, this modified version came into being.
